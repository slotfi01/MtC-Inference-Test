abstract = {We show that internationally diversified portfolios carry sizeable political risk premia and expose investors to tail risk. We obtain political efficient frontiers with and without hedging political risk using a portfolio selection model for skewed distributions and develop a new asymptotic inference test to compare portfolio performance. Politically hedged portfolios outperform a broad market index and the equally weighted portfolio for US, Eurozone, and Japanese investors. Political risk hedging is not subsumed by currency hedging, and the diversification gains of politically hedged portfolios persist under currency hedging and transaction cost frictions. Hedging political risk induces equity home bias but does not fully explain the puzzle.}

## ðŸ“„ About the Paper

This paper addresses how political riskâ€”a global, non-diversifiable factorâ€”affects international portfolio performance. The authors:

- Develop a portfolio selection model that incorporates political risk hedging using a second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) consistent criterion, the **Mean-to-CVaR (MtC) ratio.
- Introduce a novel asymptotic inference test for comparing MtC performance across portfolios, filling a methodological gap in the literature.
- Empirically show that politically hedged portfolios outperform both market indices and equally weighted portfolios across the U.S., Eurozone, and Japan.
- Demonstrate that political risk remains material even after currency hedging and during events like **COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

mtc_cvr_inf_test test
                        H0: MTC(rt1) - MTC(rt0) = 0
                        H1: MTC(rt1) - MTC(rt0) > 0
 and
                        H0: CVaR(rt1) - CVaR(rt0) = 0
                        H1: CVaR(rt1) - CVaR(rt0) > 0
 and
                        H0: SHR(rt1) - SHR(rt0) = 0
                        H1: SHR(rt1) - SHR(rt0) > 0

and report the p-values along with differences of MTCs and CVaRs

Inputs:
b: Length of block
B: Number of bootstrap iterations
rt1, rt0: Return (or excess return) time series with length of S from
which we resample blocks of length b with replacement
alpha: Confidence level for calculating CVaR and MTC

Outputs:
mtc_diff: MTC(rt1) - MTC(rt0)
cvr_diff: CVaR(rt1) - CVaR(rt0)
mtc_pval: The p-value of testing MTC differences
cvr_pval: The p-value of testing CVaR differences

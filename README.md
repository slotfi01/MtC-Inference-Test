## ðŸ“„ About the Paper

This paper addresses how **political risk**â€”a global, non-diversifiable factorâ€”affects international portfolio performance. The authors:

- Develop a portfolio selection model that incorporates political risk hedging using a second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) consistent criterion, the **Mean-to-CVaR (MtC) ratio.
- Introduce a novel asymptotic inference test for comparing MtC performance across portfolios, filling a methodological gap in the literature.
- Empirically show that politically hedged portfolios outperform both market indices and equally weighted portfolios across the U.S., Eurozone, and Japan.
- Demonstrate that political risk remains material even after currency hedging and during events like **COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine.

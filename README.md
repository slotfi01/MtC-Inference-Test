## ðŸ“„ About the Paper

This paper shows how political risk â€”a global, non-diversifiable P-factorâ€” affects international portfolio performance. It achieves four things:
- Develop a portfolio selection model that incorporates political risk hedging using a second-order stochastic dominance consistent criterion, the **Mean-to-CVaR (MtC) ratio.
- Introduce a novel asymptotic inference test for comparing MtC performance across portfolios, filling a methodological gap in the literature.
- Empirically show that politically hedged portfolios outperform both market indices and equally weighted portfolios across the U.S., Eurozone, and Japan.
- Demonstrate that political risk remains material even after currency hedging and during events like **COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

mtc_cvr_inf_test test
                        H0: MTC(rt1) - MTC(rt0) = 0
                        H1: MTC(rt1) - MTC(rt0) > 0
 and
                        H0: CVaR(rt1) - CVaR(rt0) = 0
                        H1: CVaR(rt1) - CVaR(rt0) > 0
 and
                        H0: SHR(rt1) - SHR(rt0) = 0
                        H1: SHR(rt1) - SHR(rt0) > 0

and report the p-values along with differences of MTCs and CVaRs

Inputs:
b: Length of block
B: Number of bootstrap iterations
rt1, rt0: Return (or excess return) time series with length of S from
which we resample blocks of length b with replacement
alpha: Confidence level for calculating CVaR and MTC

Outputs:
mtc_diff: MTC(rt1) - MTC(rt0)
cvr_diff: CVaR(rt1) - CVaR(rt0)
mtc_pval: The p-value of testing MTC differences
cvr_pval: The p-value of testing CVaR differences
